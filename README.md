/**
 * This is an example of bad programming - kept as a reminder to me of when I first 
 * started circa 2011. I did not know about object-orientation or arrays.
 * 
 * The inspiration for this came fromthe answer to the "100 Prisoners and a 
 * Lightbulb" riddle:
 *  
 * There are 100 prisoners in solitary cells. There's a central living room with one
 * light bulb; this bulb is initially off. No prisoner can see the light bulb from
 * his or her own cell. Everyday, the warden picks a prisoner equally at random, 
 * and that prisoner visits the living room. While there, the prisoner can toggle 
 * the bulb if he or she wishes. Also, the prisoner has the option of asserting 
 * that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room by now. If this assertion 
 * is false, all 100 prisoners are executed. However, if it is indeed true, all 
 * prisoners are set free. Thus, the assertion should only be made if the prisoner 
 * is 100% certain of its validity. The prisoners are allowed to get together one 
 * night in the courtyard, to discuss a plan. What plan should they agree on, so 
 * that eventually, someone will make a correct assertion?
 * 
 * I wanted to know how long it would take. Prisoners runs each simulation numRuns
 * times and outputs the shortest time it took, the longest time it took, and the
 * average time taken of the total number of runs.
